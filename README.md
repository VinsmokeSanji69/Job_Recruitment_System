# Job Recruitment System

This is a web-based job marketplace system that connects **clients** (employers) and **talents** (freelancers). The platform facilitates job postings, proposal submissions, contract management, and mutual reviews between users.

> 💡 **Note:** A user can act both as a client and a talent. For example, someone can post a job (as a client) and also apply to another job (as a talent).
